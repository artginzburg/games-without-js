## TODO

- [x] Adapt to light theme
- [x] Rewrite all queries from strings to object literals
- [ ] Add type annotations for queries
- [ ] Rename `enabled` to `guessed`
- [ ] Use `aria-label` or `title` to make all the Links accessible.
- [ ] Add CSS-only tooltips instead of `title` for disabled elements, or make the disabled styles more obvious where they're not (e.g. in board size buttons container).

## Ideas

- Make it possible to require 3, 4, 5 or whatever more cards to match.
