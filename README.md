# Games without JS

No client-side JavaScript, relying purely on SSR and CSS. Disable JS in your browser for an immersive experience

## How to contribute

> Contributions do not have to be big. Any input is valuable, so don't be shy.

You can:

- Implement new games.
  > To do that, pick a game from the "Coming soon" list, create a new directory in `src/app/` and make the game. It's OK to just implement the logic. OK to only implement HTML markup and some styling. It's completely OK to leave it as a draft and abandon it.
- Add new games to the "Coming soon" list.
  > Whatever you feel would be playable without JS. If you're not sure if a game is possible to implement — open an Issue instead of a PR.
- Implement TODOs that are listed in the ReadMes of each game directory. Or find and fix TODOs and BUGs as comments in the code.
- Open Issues with your ideas towards improving the project.
  > Ideas can be anything — suggested patterns and classes, game design decisions, missing documentation, new helpful libraries or even frameworks. Suggestions regarding coordination of the repo and the asynchronous work between contributors are also much welcome.

The only thing to remember is that as part of the challenge, you are not allowed to directly use any client-side JS. Automatic stuff that makes page transitions faster using JS is fine (e.g. Next.js).

## Why? Why would anyone do that ever?

I've just never seen anything like this, never heard of the idea, and when I told some tech guys about it — I only received positive feedback. It's technically the weirdest way to implement a game that I know of. And whatever is unknown and weird, but also seems like fun — is in my opinion worth exploring.
